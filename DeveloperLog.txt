Problems encountered:
1. Finding a dataset is difficult. Either the data quality is of poor quality, or the dataset is too large. 
Finally, I reluctantly choosed a dataset of 1GB on Kaggle

2. Without a GPU, parallel operations cannot be performed. Unable to use transformer, only traditional
 CNN algorithm can be used for image recognition. 
 
3. I tried running locally, but even if I cut the dataset by 4/5, the time of reading images was too long.
 So I decided to rent a server online.

4. Attempting to find a server, but generally requiring huge payment or bank card binding. Google Colab is a piece
of junk, often disconnecting from the server. Finally, found Autodl, a relatively good computing platform

5. Although the model was successfully trained in the end, at first it only outputed "nothing". I increased 
the number of training epoch, and although the output did vary, none of the predictions were correct.

6. I don't think making prediction solely based on images is very effective. I tried to use mediapipe to find 
the position of each hand joints and then trained a simple MLP based on the positions. It did work out perfectly.

7. I found out some images are pretty dim. So I made an auto adjustment of brightness of each picture. The prediction
is more precise
